✅ Fixes made:  

✅ Fixes made:  
- Every code block (` ```bash `) is properly **closed** before starting the next heading.  
- Removed accidental spaces that could make headings look like plain text.  
- Clean and consistent heading levels.  

If you paste **this exact content** into GitHub’s README editor, you’ll get proper heading sizes for **2️⃣ Open in Google Colab** and all sections after it.  

Do you want me to also **embed your actual accuracy score from Colab into the Example Output section** so it looks more complete?
